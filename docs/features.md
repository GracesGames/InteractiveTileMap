The __Interactive Tile Map__ provides functionality to:

* Replace tiles with actors
* Replace tiles with paper flipbook actors or paper flipbook components
* Attach the spawned actor or component to the paper tile map actor
* Have the actor receive a custom event on spawn including the tile User Data Name
* Find and return tile transforms for your own use case (e.g. spawn points)
* Clear tiles that should only exist in the tile map
* Identify tiles by Tile Identifier (i.e. TileSet + Index) or tile User Data Name
* Include and exclude specific layers to improve performance
